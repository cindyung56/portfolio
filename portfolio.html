<p class="left">My name is Cindy Ung and I have recently graduated from the University of California, Irvine (UCI).
I have a Bachelor's degree in Informatics with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction.
Currently I am learning how to apply JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create websites and edit pages.
I also have experience using Adobe Photoshop for graphic design and digital art.
Even though my current field of expertise and interest is design, I also have knowledge of coding and
have learned the programming languages Java and Python.
I strongly believe that the product and program should always keep in mind user experience and accessibility.
Features and functions are constantly designed and tested repeatedly to be easy to understand and use for all targeted users.
I aim to design my apps and programs to make sure as many customers as possible are satisfied
and that they are able to do what they intended without struggling, no matter their level of technological knowledge.
</p>

<p class="left"> My hobbies are drawing, reading, writing, watching cat videos, and playing games.
  Some of my favorite games include but are not limited to: Amnesia: Memories, Pokemon, Fire Emblem, and Story of Seasons.
  For fellow cat lovers, my favorite cat channels on YouTube are SuriNoel and Cream Heroes.（Φ ω Φ）
  I also have been studying Japanese daily for about seven years so I am fairly confident in my ability to read and listen.
  I am always learning the language and seek to expand my vocabulary and expertise each day.
  I play many Japanese mobile games and enjoy watching anime and variety shows, which is also another way for me to study.
  I am highly interested in Japanese culture and would like to travel to Japan one day on a trip.
